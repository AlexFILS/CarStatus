# CarStatus
For car services and their customers.

The project contains 2 sides:
-Service side
-Customer site

The service will add any car that comes through its doors, set up a list of TODOs on that car: strip doors, repaint door, refit door and so on. The status of the car is constantly updated, so the customer can view its status. The customer can use a code to search for their car and see the progress on it, and also what needs to be done until the due date.
